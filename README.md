PHP-log-digester
================

A PHP script that will read and analyze your php error log and spit out a more readable version with the worst errors highlighted so you can fix those first.

This project is really old and no longer used or maintained by me.  It may not work on newer versions of PHP. I am putting it here for archival purposes.
